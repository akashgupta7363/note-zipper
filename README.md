## Introduction

The MERN Notes Management Web App is designed to help users create, organize, and manage their notes efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can create, view, edit, and delete their notes securely. This project demonstrates my ability to develop a complete web application using the MERN stack, showcasing both front-end and back-end skills.

## Technologies Used

The MERN Notes Management Web App utilizes the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing note data.
- **Express.js**: A back-end framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.
- **Mongoose**: An object modeling tool for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests from the front-end.
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first web development.

## Features

The MERN Notes Management Web App offers the following features:

- User authentication and authorization.
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on notes.
- Real-time updates with WebSocket integration.
- Rich text editing capabilities for note content.
- Categorization and tagging of notes for better organization.
- Search functionality to find notes based on keywords or categories.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-notes-app.git`.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory and install the dependencies for the back-end by running `npm install`.
3. Navigate to the `client` directory and install the front-end dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Configure the MongoDB connection by adding your MongoDB URI in the `.env` file.
5. Run the back-end server using `npm run server` from the root directory.
6. Run the front-end development server using `npm start` from the `client` directory.

Note: Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine.

## Usage
